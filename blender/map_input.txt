# resource mapping to ids for simpler cpp management
# this does not account for scene numbers, those are represented directly in blender
# internally loaded by map.py, make sure all object names are represented exactly as they're found in blender

# map.py: if an unmapped object (object whose name does not appear here) is encountered, its id will be "X"

# format: id name
# id can be anything not just numbers, but it should be a number (because later cpp usage implementation)
# names can be anything not just numbers, but they must be unique
# hash-lines are comments
# must match map.h ITMTYPE
